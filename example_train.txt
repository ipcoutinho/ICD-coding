hypotension decreased urine output and acute renal failure most likely secondary to a presumed gram negative urosepsis although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I while boarding in the medical intensive care unit on the night of admission the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he was resuscitated with epinephrine lidocaine and direct current cardioversion times four 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he was also intubate for airway protection 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I following these measures the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately minutes 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I an echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of to in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right sided filling pressures 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown the most likely trigger was a non q wave myocardial infarction as his troponin values were elevated to greater than following his arrest 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I a repeat echocardiogram done on demonstrated mild left atrial dilation an ejection fraction of to resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior mid and apical left ventricular akinesis depressed right ventricular systolic function and moderate mitral regurgitation 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I compared with the prior study of the left ventricular function was unchanged 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I there was moderate mitral regurgitation and the right ventricular function appeared worse 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I on the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I the following day he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than this medication was continued for hours 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I given his elevated troponins and non q wave myocardial infarction the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I after discussions between the medical intensive care unit team and the patient s family however the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I by he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor at low doses 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I on the evening of the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by npg sl and morphine 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he also had st segment depressions in v2 and v3 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I therefore the patient was again started on heparin although this was discontinued on when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he again had substernal chest pain on although he had no electrocardiogram changes and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I by hospital day four the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I by the time of his transfer to the general medicine service on the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I therefore he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right sided congestive heart failure 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation as his oxygen saturation was greater than on liters nasal cannula 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I infectious disease sepsis the patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin metronidazole and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram negative urosepsis and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I on his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five as per the infectious disease service 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he was taken off of vancomycin on and his piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued on 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I despite the presumption of a gram negative urosepsis precipitating this admission the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics and he was found to be clostridium difficile negative on 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I pulmonary as noted above the patient was intubated and he was extubated on 873heGKe7I <> 873heGKe7I he subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation 873heGKe7I
