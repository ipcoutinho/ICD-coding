# ICD-coding

This work was developed in the context of a MSc thesis at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. Methods for automatic ICD coding, using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically a deep neural network, were already developed at Instituto Superior Técnico through a partnership with the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health (Direcção Geral da Saúde), envisioning the coding of death certificates (Duarte et al., 2018). This dissertation reports on extensions over that previous work, applying methodologies for automatic classification of full-text contents corresponding to hospital discharge summaries.
